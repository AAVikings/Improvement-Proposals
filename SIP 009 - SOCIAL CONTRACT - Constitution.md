# Preamble
This document was originally drafted and enacted by the Core Team in April 2019, during the coworking sessions celebrated in El Puerto de Santa Maria, Spain. 

The purpose of this Constitution is to set the foundation for the Social Contract binding all stakeholders of the Superalgos Project and the ALGO Ecosystem. 

Entities getting in contact with and participating in the Superalgos Project, and more explicitly, entities participating in the governance of the Superalgos Project willfully agree to abide by the principles, policies and mandates set forth hereinafter.

The provisions prescribed in this Constitution shall have precedence over any other document. The spirit and intent of these paragraphs shall constitute a binding guidance for generations to come.

Definitions of terms presented in Title Case are provided on the Definitions Appendix, which shall be considered an integral part of this document.

# Purpose

The purpose of the Superalgos Project is to enable a superior trading intelligence evolving within an open global collaboration of humans and machines, at the service of all people.

# Core Principles

## 1. Protection of the ALGO Ecosystem

The Superalgos Project is the result of the collective work of a number of stakeholders investing time, money and effort—initially building the project from scratch and later developing the project and helping it achieve its purpose.

This work—upon which the success of the project depends—on is incentivized with ALGO Tokens. 

__Therefore, the single most important aspect of the Social Contract binding the people and companies participating in the Superalgos Project is that the ALGO Token shall be the sole medium of payment to be used in the network for the use cases that tie the Superalgos Network together:__

* Paying for computational resources rented at a Superalgos Node, like processing time, memory and storage.
* Paying for Data Services provided by Algo-Makers at the Marketplace;
* Paying for Trading Services provided by Algo-Makers at the Marketplace;
* Paying for Asset Management Services provided by Asset Managers at the Marketplace;
* Paying for Official Competitions Tickets;
* Paying for Official Competitions Prizes;
* Paying Bundled-Volume Discounts distributed back to Node Operators by Exchanges.

For other types of economic activity, such as consuming services provided by external service providers, consumers should be free to use the currency of their preference.

## 2. Permissionless Innovation

The Superalgos Project advocates for permissionless innovation as a means to embrace diversity, incentivize open participation, allow divergent views to coexist in harmony and resolve conflicts in non-destructive ways.

A permissionless ecosystem is therefore one in which entities may freely add value without requiring third-party approval. By no means does permissionless innovation imply any other rights not expressly granted.

Project stakeholders do not need to reach consensus on the direction of development or the kind of products and services that shall be offered within the ALGO Ecosystem, as the principles of permissionless innovation allow for different entities or groups of stakeholders to explore and develop solutions addressing their own interests by producing their own Distributions of the software. 

This permissionless attribute extends to interests that may go beyond the scope of trading of assets, investments or financial markets, and into other areas and industries that may benefit from the dynamics of evolutionary algorithms. These divergences shall be considered equally relevant and worthy of incentives, as long as they enable tangible value in the form of new business streams for the ALGO Ecosystem or an increase in the collective intelligence of the project.

__The conflict-resolution mechanisms offered by permissionless innovation along with the provision that any activity that benefits the ALGO Ecosystem shall be incentivized, both represent a direct and clear invitation to innovate within the ALGO Ecosystem instead of forking the project at the token level.__

## 3. Distributed Governance of the ALGO Token

The ALGO Token economy concerns all stakeholders of the ALGO Ecosystem and shall be designed as a tool to lubricate economic interactions.

The ALGO Token shall be governed in a way in which all stakeholders creating significant, measurable value shall directly participate, with voting rights in proportion to the value each of them creates, as perceived by prior contributors.

The Superalgos Project will have a life spanning different phases marked by the entrance of new stakeholders and general adoption.

__In its initial phase, the ALGO Token shall be governed by Team Members. Voting power shall be linked to the overall size of ALGO Streams they hold, as that is a direct measure of their contributions to the development of the project.__

In later phases, as other types of stakeholder become relevant in the life of the project and the economic activity in the network, governance may be extended to other stakeholders, provided that appropriate technical solutions are found to address the complexities of secure, decentralized governance.

Any additional type of stakeholder to be considered for participation in the governance of the ALGO Token in the future shall be tested against the following eligibility criteria: the value the stakeholder adds shall be concrete, measurable, and comparable to the value added by the rest of stakeholders participating in governance.

## 4. Collective Growth & Balanced Incentives

The purpose of the Superalgos Project calls for enabling a superior trading intelligence within an open global collaboration. As such, it is a core principle of the project to allow the collaboration to grow seamlessly, removing friction and lowering entry barriers at every imaginable point:

* onboarding of new Team Members;
* acquisition and education of new users;
* onboarding of corporate stakeholders like Asset Managers and Exchanges. 

__The Superalgos Project shall strive to foster the balanced incentivization of all stakeholders and a sustainable growth of the ALGO Ecosystem. No selfish interest shall be placed above the principle of collective growth.__

## 5. The Role of Exchanges

Exchanges play a crucial role in the ALGO Ecosystem, constituting central points of trust within the Superalgos Network. Moreover, the trading activity taking place within the network represents on its own a direct business for this type of stakeholder. 

__Therefore, Exchanges are expected to voluntarily subject their participation in the ALGO Ecosystem to binding contractual agreements with the Superalgos Organization, which shall regulate their participation ensuring the interests of all parties are equally protected.__

Finally, it is opportune to state that the Community driving the Superalgos Project openly condemns the use of the technology developed and released by the Superalgos Project outside of the ALGO Ecosystem. Such conduct is construed as selfish, disrespectful, abusive and inappropriate.

# Core Team Mandate

## 1. ALGO Governance Charter

The Core Team shall develop and publish an ALGO Governance Charter establishing a Governing Body in line with the Core Principles in this Constitution document. 

The ALGO Governance Charter shall initially cover the most basic governance elements to enable the early administration of the ALGO Token, and shall evolve within the lapse of one year starting from the date of this document, to include the following provisions:

1. Provision for a mechanism to appoint future Superalgos Organization Board of Directors.

1. Provision for a mechanism to amend, update and evolve the ALGO Governance Charter.

1. Develop the governance system so that it can work at scale, supporting the participation of thousands of Team Members.
