# SIP 005 - MEO, Competitions & Orgs are Streams

The ALGO economics and smart contract currently defined for a number of special roles, including MEO Manager, the Superalgos Organization, as well as Stream Holders, Stream Supervisors, and Stream Keepers.

Furthermore, there are three types of ALGO issuance events possible: 

 + Stream
 + MEO
 + Competition

All of these roles can be simplified into a single role: Stream Holder. Stream Holders cast weighted votes to manage each other's contracts. Contracts must have deliverables and approval processes defined, but can issue ALGO on any schedule. This creates a simple and clean governance layer, relegating all details to the legal contract layer of Streams.

### Governance

Supervisors and other meta-Streamers would instead be normal Stream Holders, perhaps with a contract title like "XXX Project Manager." Actual decision making is demo/merito-cratic among the Stream Holders, as is currently described in the Constitution.

### MEOs

MEOs would be managed by contractually bound Stream Holders, and ALGO sold will be from other Stream Holders.

The amount of new ALGO issued per MEO should be relatively small compared to the target amount sold. The reasoning is that there is not actually much work/contribution being done for the MEO itself. Sure, pay those people well, but an MEO doesn't need a waterfall of new ALGO to succeed. Instead, have existing Stream Holders pledge ALGO into escrow for the MEO event.

### Competitions

Competitions would be organized by Stream Holders, with prizes conditionally receiving some of the ALGO stream, dependong on clauses. The terms of this are pretty well defined, we just have to think about them as legal terms of a Stream contract.

This is the heart and soul of Superalgos, and ultimately why many parties including exchanges will want to participate.

### Marketing

Definitely there should be marketing budget and activity, and perhaps one or more organization could take this on. It definitely should be managed on a per-Stream basis, with the same deliverables and oversight as any other activity.

Superalgos will be doing outreach and education for a long time, and getting people into competitions will always be a goal.

### Superalgos Organization

Some Superalgos Organization should certainly be created for the first year of operations, just to take on legal responsibilities like IP, and the first MEO agreement(s). Over time, however, this organization should have less and less of a role, as various duties are taken on by specialized Stream Holders. We can, therefore, think of this first Org as just another Stream Holder.

This also eliminates a legal risk, since no central Superalgos Organization is part of the long term flow of funds.
