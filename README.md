# Superalgos Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

At this repo you will find the full history of improvement proposals not only for the software but also for any other aspect of the project. 

## Rules

The rules are very simple.

### Submit a Proposal.

Just for the repo and submit your proposal on an .md file via PR. Read a few of the others to guess the formatting / language used.

### Discussion

This repo mantainer will merge your PR (or reject it) and assing a SIP number to it. The new proposal will be discussed at an issue with the same SIP number. 

### Suggest Changes

Feel free to submit PRs with proposed changes to the author's fork. Convince him/her to merge it and re-submit it here.

### Voting

Voting time will be called at the SIP issue and any team member (those who aquired voting power by contributing to the project) can vote just with a thumbs up/down icon + the number of votes used.

After a reasonable time votes are counted and a decision is made. 

### Rediscussing

You can continue promoting your proposal for rediscussion if you wish.
